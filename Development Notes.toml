# Rules
    # Try to be concise

    # Information Formatting
        # A singular unit of information is called an entry
            # Each entry must have a section for a name, note, and comment
                # The name should be accurate and the first letter of each word must be capitalized
                # The note should contain a definition or explanation and the first letter of the first word must be capitalized
                # The comment can contain anything

        # Information within an entry is called a section
            # Other sections may be added including:
                # Unit: to describe the symbol used to represent a measurement
                # Measurement: to describe measurements, ratios, volumes, ect

            # If a new section is added it must be within a neat format and written within the rules

        # An if an entry contains other entries it is considered a category
            # A category is written in the same manner as an entry

    # Notes
        # Space at the start of each note
        # Capitalize the first letter at the start of each note
        # Do not use punctuation at the end
        # Category side notes
            # Write "End of (name of category)" if the category consists of 5 or more entries, this is at the end of the category 

        # Edit History
            # The date, and time spend working must be recorded
            # If a category is created it is written "added (name of category)"
            # If a category is added to it is written "extended (name of category)"
            # If an objective is created it is written "started objective [Objective Name]"
            # If an objective is finished it is written "completed objective [Objective Name]"
            # If a task is added is it written "added Task_(task number) in objective [Objective Name]"
            # If a task was worked on but not completed is it written "worked on Task_(task number) in objective [Objective Name]"
            # If a task is completed is it written "completed Task_(task number) in objective [Objective Name]"
            # Categories must not be considered "finished", there is always more to be learned
            # Deletions of catagories will not be noted
            # Minor or insignificant additions / extensions should not be noted but they can
            # Edit history can be vague and it does not have to be absolutely precise. It should aim to get the general message across of what was done that day

    # Objectives
        # Each objective should have a clear focus
        # Tasks in an objective should aim to take no longer than a day but they can
        # The order objectives and tasks are written should be chronologically completed but they do not have to
